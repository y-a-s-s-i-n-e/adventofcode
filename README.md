# Advent Of Code (2015 - ...)

Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! Here, you’ll find my C# solutions to the Advent of Code challenges, starting from 2015 onwards. 

Each year, Advent of Code presents a series of coding puzzles throughout December, providing an excellent way to practice problem-solving and explore C# capabilities.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- **Year**: Each top-level folder represents a specific year (e.g., `2015`, `2016`, etc.).
- **Day**: Inside each year folder, there are subfolders for each day of the challenge (e.g., `Day01`, `Day02`, etc.).
  - **Core**: Contains the core solution code for that day's challenge, designed to process a given input.
  - **Test**: Contains the input and tests to verify the solution’s accuracy against the actual challenge data.

## Technologies
- **Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET Core (or newer, depending on the challenge requirements)
- **IDE**: Rider

## How to Run
To execute a solution for a specific day:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the desired year and day folder.
3. Run the solution using the .NET CLI or open it directly in Rider.
